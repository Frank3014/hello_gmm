1. This is a simple GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) implemented in c++.
2. It is need to determine the number of classifications in GMM.
3. GMM is sensitive to initialization the center of mass for each classification.
4. The optimal solution may not be obtained if the mean initialization is unreasonable.
5. GMM usually needs K-means or other algorithm to calculate the mean initialize value.
